# ChessEngine
Due to slow runtime speed of python, I decided to write a chess engine in C++.

# What is done
Bitboards implementation <br>
Attacks generation and implementation of magic bitboards for sliding pieces <br>
Parsing FEN string <br>

# Credits
Big shoutout to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB9-prLkPwgvlKKqDgXhsMQ">Code Monkey King</a>
His tutorials on chess engine in C are amazing.<br>
I'm following his series and in the same time - I'm trying to improve the code along the way.
